This documentation is meant for C++ developers who want to include the Quetzal
Coalescence Template Library (Quetzal-CoalTL) in their own code project.

Coalescence is a mathematical abstraction that is useful for solving many types
of problems in computational population genetics. Consequently, the abstractions of
coalescence theory must also be represented in computer programs.

A standardized generic interface for manipulating concepts like genes genealogies, 
lineages colliders, mutation, recombination, landscapes,
demographic history,
reproduction, migration is of utmost importance to
encourage reuse of algorithms and data structures. This library intends to do this
for the C++ language.
